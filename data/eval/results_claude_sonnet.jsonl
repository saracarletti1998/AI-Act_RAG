A key characteristic of AI systems is their\ncapability to infer. This capability to infer refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content,\nrecommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual environments, and to a capability of AI\nsystems to derive models or algorithms, or both, from inputs or data. The techniques that enable inference while\nbuilding an AI system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives,\nand logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic representation of the\ntask to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer transcends basic data processing by enabling learning,\nreasoning or modelling. The term ‘machine-based’ refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference\nto explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives or\nto implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system\nin a specific context. For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood to be the contexts in\nwhich the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system reflect different functions performed by\nAI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with\nvarying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human\ninvolvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could\nexhibit after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use. AI systems\ncan be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically\nintegrated into the product (embedded) or serves the functionality of the product without being integrated therein\n(non-embedded).\n(13) The notion of ‘deployer’ referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any natural or legal person, including\na public authority, agency or other body, using an AI system under its", "least the following information, as applicable to\nthe relevant AI system:\n1.

Although AI models are essential\ncomponents of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models require the addition of further\ncomponents, such as for example a user interface, to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and\nform part of AI systems.

In any event, any research and development activity should be\ncarried out in accordance with recognised ethical and professional standards for scientific research and should be\nconducted in accordance with applicable Union law.\n(26) In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a clearly defined risk-based\napproach should be followed. That approach should tailor the type and content of such rules to the intensity and\nscope of the risks that AI systems can generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable AI practices,\nto lay down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and to lay down\ntransparency obligations for certain AI systems.\nOJ L, 12.7.2024 EN\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj 7/144\n(27) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to\nrecall the 2019 Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI developed by the independent AI HLEG appointed by the\nCommission. In those guidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which are\nintended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include human agency and\noversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination\nand fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding\nrequirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those guidelines contribute to the design of\ncoherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is\nfounded. According to the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are\ndeveloped and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is\nfunctioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety", "market, put into service or used for military, defence or national security\npurposes is used outside those temporarily or permanently for other purposes, for example, civilian or humanitarian\npurposes, law enforcement or public security purposes, such a system would fall within the scope of this Regulation.\nIn that case, the entity using the AI system for other than military, defence or national security purposes should\nensure the compliance of the AI system with this Regulation, unless the system is already compliant with this\nRegulation. AI systems placed on the market or put into service for an excluded purpose, namely military, defence or\nnational security, and one or more non-excluded purposes, such as civilian purposes or law enforcement, fall within\nthe scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems should ensure compliance with this Regulation. In those\ncases, the fact that an AI system may fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of\nentities carrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of entity carrying out\nthose activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and defence purposes, the use of which is excluded\nfrom the scope of this Regulation. An AI system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes\nwhich is used with or without modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall within\nthe scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities.\n(25) This Regulation should support innovation, should respect freedom of science, and should not undermine research\nand development activity.

Those rules should be consistent\nwith the Charter, non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments. They should\nalso take into account the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade and the\nEthics guidelines for trustworthy AI of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG).\n(8) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster the development, use\nand uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such\nas health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and\nenvironmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law.

For systemic-risk GPAI models, stricter risk-mitigation and cybersecurity requirements apply.", "model_answer": "# Regulation of General-Purpose AI Models under the EU AI Act\n\nBased on the provided excerpts, the EU AI Act regulates general-purpose AI (GPAI) models through a tiered approach with specific obligations:\n\n## 1. **General Obligations for All GPAI Model Providers**\n\nAccording to **Article 53(1), point (b)** and **Annex XII**, providers must provide technical documentation to downstream providers, including:\n- General description (intended tasks, acceptable use policies, release date, architecture, parameters, modality)\n- Development process elements (technical integration means, input/output specifications, training data information)\n\nThe obligations apply **once models are placed on the market** (Recital 97). Models used solely for internal processes not affecting third parties' rights are exempt, though GPAI models with systemic risk remain subject to obligations.\n\n## 2. **Classification of GPAI Models with Systemic Risk**\n\n**Article 51** establishes that a GPAI model is classified as having systemic risk if:\n- **(a)** It has high impact capabilities evaluated through appropriate technical tools and methodologies; OR\n- **(b)** The Commission decides it has equivalent capabilities based on criteria in **Annex XIII**\n\n**Article 51(2)** creates a **presumption**: models trained with cumulative computation **greater than 10²⁵ floating point operations** are presumed to have high impact capabilities.\n\n## 3. **Additional Obligations for Systemic Risk Models**\n\nAccording to **Recital 114**, providers of GPAI models with systemic risks must:\n- Perform model evaluations, including **adversarial testing** (internal or independent external)\n- Continuously assess and mitigate systemic risks\n- Implement risk-management policies with accountability and governance processes\n- Conduct post-market monitoring\n- Report serious incidents without undue delay (Recital 115)\n\n## 4. **Notification Procedure**\n\n**Article 52(1)** requires providers to **notify the Commission within two weeks** when their model meets the systemic risk threshold.\n\n**Article 52(2)** allows providers to present substantiated arguments that their model should not be classified as systemic risk despite meeting the threshold, due to specific characteristics.\n\n## 5. **", "contexts": ["for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with\nsystemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on.

To achieve those objectives, this Regulation should\nrequire providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in particular prior to its first placing on the market,\nincluding conducting and documenting adversarial testing of models, also, as appropriate, through internal or\nindependent external testing. In addition, providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should\ncontinuously assess and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting in place risk-management policies,\nsuch as accountability and governance processes, implementing post-market monitoring, taking appropriate\nmeasures along the entire model’s lifecycle and cooperating with relevant actors along the AI value chain.\n(115) Providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate possible systemic risks.

It should be understood that the obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI\nmodels should apply once the general-purpose AI models are placed on the market. When the provider of\na general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or\nput into service, that model should be considered to be placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this\nRegulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations laid down for\nmodels should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely internal processes that are not essential\nfor providing a product or a service to third parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering\ntheir potential significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should always be\nsubject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation.

AI systems placed on the market or put into service for an excluded purpose, namely military, defence or\nnational security, and one or more non-excluded purposes, such as civilian purposes or law enforcement, fall within\nthe scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems should ensure compliance with this Regulation. In those\ncases, the fact that an AI system may fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of\nentities carrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of entity carrying out\nthose activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and defence purposes, the use of which is excluded\nfrom the scope of this Regulation. An AI system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes\nwhich is used with or without modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall within\nthe scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities.\n(25) This Regulation should support innovation, should respect freedom of science, and should not undermine research\nand development activity. It is therefore necessary to exclude from its scope AI systems and models specifically\ndeveloped and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development. Moreover, it is necessary\nto ensure that this Regulation does not otherwise affect scientific research and development activity on AI systems or\nmodels prior to being placed on the market or put into service. As regards product-oriented research, testing and\ndevelopment activity regarding AI systems or models, the provisions of this Regulation should also not apply prior\nto those systems and models being put into service or placed on the market. That exclusion is without prejudice to\nthe obligation to comply with this Regulation where an AI system falling into the scope of this Regulation is placed\non the market or put into service as a result of such research and development activity and to the application of\nprovisions on AI regulatory sandboxes and testing in real world conditions. Furthermore, without prejudice to the\nexclusion of AI systems specifically developed and put into service for the sole", "an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI\nmodels should apply once the general-purpose AI models are placed on the market. When the provider of\na general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or\nput into service, that model should be considered to be placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this\nRegulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations laid down for\nmodels should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely internal processes that are not essential\nfor providing a product or a service to third parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering\ntheir potential significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should always be\nsubject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition should not cover AI models used before their\nplacing on the market for the sole purpose of research, development and prototyping activities. This is without\nprejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is placed on the\nmarket.\n(98) Whereas the generality of a model could, inter alia, also be determined by a number of parameters, models with at\nleast a billion of parameters and trained with a large amount of data using self-supervision at scale should be\nconsidered to display significant generality and to competently perform a wide range of distinctive tasks.\n(99) Large generative AI models are a typical example for a general-purpose AI model, given that they allow for flexible\ngeneration of content, such as in the form of text, audio, images or video, that can readily accommodate a wide\nrange of distinctive tasks.\n(100) When a general-purpose AI model is integrated into or forms part of an AI system, this system should be considered\nto be general-purpose AI system when, due to this integration, this system has the capability to serve a variety of\npurposes. A general-purpose AI system can be used directly, or it may be integrated into other AI systems.\nEN OJ L, 12.7.2024\n26/144 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n(101) Providers of general-purpose AI models have a particular role and responsibility along the AI value chain, as the\nmodels they provide may form the basis for a range of downstream systems, often provided by", "98(2).\n7.

Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox at national\nlevel, which shall be operational by 2 August 2026. That sandbox may also be established jointly with the competent\nauthorities of other Member States. The Commission may provide technical support, advice and tools for the establishment\nand operation of AI regulatory sandboxes.\nThe obligation under the first subparagraph may also be fulfilled by participating in an existing sandbox in so far as that\nparticipation provides an equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States.\n2. Additional AI regulatory sandboxes at regional or local level, or established jointly with the competent authorities of\nother Member States may also be established.\n3. The European Data Protection Supervisor may also establish an AI regulatory sandbox for Union institutions, bodies,\noffices and agencies, and may exercise the roles and the tasks of national competent authorities in accordance with this\nChapter.\n4.

Any such use should continue to occur solely in accordance with the\napplicable requirements resulting from the Charter and from the applicable acts of secondary Union law and\nnational law. This Regulation should not be understood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal\ndata, including special categories of personal data, where relevant, unless it is specifically otherwise provided for in\nthis Regulation.\n(64) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service and to ensure a high level of\ntrustworthiness, certain mandatory requirements should apply to high-risk AI systems, taking into account the\nintended purpose and the context of use of the AI system and according to the risk-management system to be\nestablished by the provider. The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory requirements of\nthis Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledged state of the art on AI, be proportionate and\neffective to meet the objectives of this Regulation. Based on the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in\nCommission notice ‘The “Blue Guide” on the implementation of EU product rules 2022’, the general rule is that\nmore than one legal act of Union harmonisation legislation may be applicable to one product, since the making\navailable or putting into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union\nharmonisation legislation. The hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern\ndifferent aspects than the existing Union harmonisation legislation and therefore the requirements of this Regulation\nwould complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation legislation. For example, machinery or medical\ndevices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety\nEN OJ L, 12", "Union legal acts related to consumer protection\nand product safety.\n10. This Regulation does not apply to obligations of deployers who are natural persons using AI systems in the course of\na purely personal non-professional activity.\n11. This Regulation does not preclude the Union or Member States from maintaining or introducing laws, regulations or\nadministrative provisions which are more favourable to workers in terms of protecting their rights in respect of the use of\nAI systems by employers, or from encouraging or allowing the application of collective agreements which are more\nfavourable to workers.\n12.

A general-purpose AI model shall be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it meets any of the\nfollowing conditions:\n(a) it has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, including\nindicators and benchmarks;\n(b) based on a decision of the Commission, ex", "43) The placing on the market, the putting into service for that specific purpose, or the use of AI systems that create or\nexpand facial recognition databases through the untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV\nfootage, should be prohibited because that practice adds to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross\nviolations of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.\n(44) There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or infer emotions, particularly\nas expression of emotions vary considerably across cultures and situations, and even within a single individual.\nAmong the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited\ngeneralisability. Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis\nof their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the\nconcerned persons. Considering the imbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the\nintrusive nature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain\nnatural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of\nAI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and\neducation should be prohibited. That prohibition should not cover AI systems placed on the market strictly for\nmedical or safety reasons, such as systems intended for therapeutical use.\n(45) Practices that are prohibited by Union law, including data protection law, non-discrimination law, consumer\nprotection law, and competition law, should not be affected by this Regulation.\n(46) High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used if they comply with\ncertain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure that high-risk AI systems available in the Union\nor whose output is otherwise used in the Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests\nas recognised and protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in the\nCommission notice ‘The “Blue Guide” on the implementation of EU product rules 2022’ (\n20), the general rule is that\nmore than one legal act of Union harmonisation legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/745 (\n21) and (EU)\n2017/746 (\n22) of the European Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC", "comply with requirements under the Directive (EU) 2019/882.\n(132) Certain AI systems intended to interact with natural persons or to generate content may pose specific risks of\nimpersonation or deception irrespective of whether they qualify as high-risk or not. In certain circumstances, the use\nof these systems should therefore be subject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the\nrequirements and obligations for high-risk AI systems and subject to targeted exceptions to take into account the\nspecial need of law enforcement. In particular, natural persons should be notified that they are interacting with an AI\nsystem, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a natural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant\nand circumspect taking into account the circumstances and the context of use. When implementing that obligation,\nthe characteristics of natural persons belonging to vulnerable groups due to their age or disability should be taken\ninto account to the extent the AI system is intended to interact with those groups as well. Moreover, natural persons\nshould be notified when they are exposed to AI systems that, by processing their biometric data, can identify or infer\nthe emotions or intentions of those persons or assign them to specific categories. Such specific categories can relate\nto aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, personal traits, ethnic origin, personal preferences and\ninterests.

In light of those impacts,\nthe fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to trace origin of information, it is\nappropriate to require providers of those systems to embed technical solutions that enable marking in a machine\nreadable format and detection that the output has been generated or manipulated by an AI system and not a human.\nSuch techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is\ntechnically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as\nwatermarks,", "of the existence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate\nmanner that does not hamper the display or enjoyment of the work, including its normal exploitation and use, while\nmaintaining the utility and quality of the work. In addition, it is also appropriate to envisage a similar disclosure\nobligation in relation to AI-generated or manipulated text to the extent it is published with the purpose of informing\nthe public on matters of public interest unless the AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or\neditorial control and a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the publication of the content.\n(135) Without prejudice to the mandatory nature and full applicability of the transparency obligations, the Commission\nmay also encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level to facilitate the effective\nimplementation of the obligations regarding the detection and labelling of artificially generated or manipulated\ncontent, including to support practical arrangements for making, as appropriate, the detection mechanisms\naccessible and facilitating cooperation with other actors along the value chain, disseminating content or checking its\nauthenticity and provenance to enable the public to effectively distinguish AI-generated content.\n(136) The obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this Regulation to enable the detection\nand disclosure that the outputs of those systems are artificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to\nfacilitate the effective implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the\nobligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and mitigate\nsystemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been artificially generated or manipulated,\nin particular the risk of the actual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and\nelectoral processes, including through disinformation. The requirement to label content generated by AI systems\nunder this Regulation is without prejudice to the obligation in Article 16(6) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 for\nproviders of hosting services to process notices on illegal content received pursuant to Article 16(1) of that\nRegulation and should not influence the assessment and the decision on the illegality of the specific content.

The risk of such biased results and discriminatory effects is\nparticularly relevant with regard to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. Remote biometric identification systems\nshould therefore be classified as high-risk in view of the risks that they pose. Such a classification excludes AI\nsystems intended to be used for biometric verification, including authentication, the sole purpose of which is to\nconfirm that a specific natural person is who that person claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person\nfor the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having secure access to premises.

The rules of this\nRegulation that prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply\nas lex specialis in respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive (EU)\n2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in an exhaustive manner.\nTherefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by\nthis Regulation, without there being scope, outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for\npurpose of law enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed\nin Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is not intended to provide the legal basis\nfor the processing of personal data under Article 8 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote\nbiometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including by\ncompetent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such use for the purpose of law\nenforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other than law enforcement should therefore not be\nsubject to the requirement of an authorisation under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law\nthat may give effect to that authorisation.\n(39) Any processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric\nidentification, other than in connection to the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly\naccessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement as regulated by this Regulation, should continue to comply\nwith all requirements resulting from Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680.

Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in\naccordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of\nquality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate\ntraceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as\nwell as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their\nrights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that\nincludes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding\ndiscriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental\nwell-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as\nwell as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the\nindividual, society and democracy. The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the\ndesign and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this\nRegulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are\nencouraged to take into account, as appropriate, the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best\npractices and standards.\n(28) Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for\nmanipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices are particularly harmful and abusive and\nshould be prohibited because they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality,\ndemocracy and the rule of law and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including the right to\nnon-discrimination, to data protection and to privacy and the rights of the child.\n(29", "process and\nthe results of its evaluation, which shall contain, at a minimum, the information set out in Annex XI for the purpose of\nproviding it, upon request, to the AI Office and the national competent authorities;\n(b) draw up, keep up-to-date and make available information and documentation to providers of AI systems who intend to\nintegrate the general-purpose AI model into their AI systems.

The placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the\nobjective to or the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in particular having\nsufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological health or financial interests are likely to occur, are\nparticularly dangerous and should therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as\naudio, image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human perception, or other\nmanipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s autonomy, decision-making or free choice in\nways that people are not consciously aware of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be\ndeceived or are not able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain interfaces\nor virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they\nmay materially distort their behaviour in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise\nexploit the vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of\nDirective (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council (\n16), or a specific social or economic\nsituation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme\npoverty, ethnic or religious minorities.

{"id": 25, "question": "How does the AI Act ensure human oversight of AI systems?", "gold_answer": "The Act requires that high-risk systems be designed to allow effective human supervision, enabling humans to understand, interpret, and override outputs when necessary.", "model_answer": "Based on the provided excerpts from the AI Act, human oversight of AI systems is ensured through the following mechanisms:\n\n## 1. **Design Requirements for Human Oversight**\n\nHigh-risk AI systems must be designed and developed to enable natural persons to oversee their functioning throughout the system's lifecycle (Recital 73). The provider must identify appropriate human oversight measures before placing the system on the market or putting it into service.\n\n## 2. **Types of Human Oversight Measures**\n\nAccording to Article 14, paragraph 3, human oversight shall be ensured through either one or both of the following:\n- **(a)** Measures identified and built into the high-risk AI system by the provider (when technically feasible)\n- **(b)** Measures identified by the provider that are appropriate to be implemented by the deployer\n\n## 3. **Capabilities Required for Oversight Personnel**\n\nThe Regulation requires that natural persons assigned to human oversight have:\n- The necessary **competence, training and authority** to carry out their role (Recital 73)\n- The ability to make **informed decisions** on if, when and how to intervene (Recital 73)\n\n## 4. **Specific Oversight Functionalities**\n\nArticle 14, paragraph 4 specifies that systems must enable oversight personnel to:\n- **(a)** Properly understand the system's capacities and limitations and monitor its operation\n- **(b)** Remain aware of automation bias tendencies\n- **(c)** Correctly interpret the system's output\n- **(d)** Decide not to use the system or disregard, override or reverse its output\n- **(e)** Intervene or interrupt the system through a 'stop' button or similar procedure\n\n## 5. **Enhanced Oversight for Biometric Identification**\n\nArticle 14, paragraph 5 establishes a stricter requirement for high-risk AI systems used for biometric identification (Annex III, point 1(a)): **no action or decision may be taken based on the system's identification unless it has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons** with the necessary competence, training and authority. This requirement does not apply to law enforcement, migration, border control and asylum contexts where Union or national law considers it disproportionate.", "contexts": ["correctly and as appropriate. In order to enhance legibility and accessibility of the information\nincluded in the instructions of use, where appropriate, illustrative examples, for instance on the limitations and on\nthe intended and precluded uses of the AI system, should be included. Providers should ensure that all\ndocumentation, including the instructions for use, contains meaningful, comprehensive, accessible and\nunderstandable information, taking into account the needs and foreseeable knowledge of the target deployers.\nInstructions for use should be made available in a language which can be easily understood by target deployers, as\ndetermined by the Member State concerned.\n(73) High-risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a way that natural persons can oversee their\nfunctioning, ensure that they are used as intended and that their impacts are addressed over the system’s lifecycle. To\nthat end, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing\non the market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the\nsystem is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive\nto the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary\ncompetence, training and authority to carry out that role. It is also essential, as appropriate, to ensure that high-risk\nAI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a natural person to whom human oversight has been assigned\nto make informed decisions if, when and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, or stop\nthe system if it does not perform as intended. Considering the significant consequences for persons in the case of an\nincorrect match by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to provide for an enhanced human\noversight requirement for those systems so that no action or decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of\nthe identification resulting from the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two\nnatural persons. Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person operating or using the\nsystem. This requirement should not pose unnecessary burden or delays and it could be sufficient that the separate\nverifications by the different persons are automatically recorded in the logs generated by the system. Given the\nspecificities of the areas of law enforcement, migration, border control and asylum, this requirement should not\napply where Union or national law considers the application of that requirement to be disproportionate.\n(74) High-risk AI systems should perform", "ers\nshould determine measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks, including for example\ngovernance arrangements in that specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the\ninstructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be instrumental in mitigating risks\nto fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the\nrelevant market surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to perform the\nimpact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI systems are used in the public sector,\ncould involve relevant stakeholders, including the representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI\nsystem, independent experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and designing\nmeasures to be taken in the case of materialisation of the risks. The European Artificial Intelligence Office (AI Office)\nshould develop a template for a questionnaire in order to facilitate compliance and reduce the administrative burden\nfor deployers.\n(97) The notion of general-purpose AI models should be clearly defined and set apart from the notion of AI systems to\nenable legal certainty. The definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI\nmodel, in particular the generality and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These\nmodels are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self-supervised,\nunsupervised or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be placed on the market in various ways,\nincluding through libraries, application programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy.\nThese models may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential\ncomponents of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models require the addition of further\ncomponents, such as for example a user interface, to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and\nform part of AI systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general-purpose AI models and for\ngeneral-purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or\nform part of an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI\nmodels should apply once the general-purpose AI models are placed on the market. When the provider of\na general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or\nput into", "risks, level of autonomy and context of use of the high-risk\nAI system, and shall be ensured through either one or both of the following types of measures:\n(a) measures identified and built, when technically feasible, into the high-risk AI system by the provider before it is placed\non the market or put into service;\n(b) measures identified by the provider before placing the high-risk AI system on the market or putting it into service and\nthat are appropriate to be implemented by the deployer.\n4. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the high-risk AI system shall be provided to the deployer in\nsuch a way that natural persons to whom human oversight is assigned are enabled, as appropriate and proportionate:\n(a) to properly understand the relevant capacities and limitations of the high-risk AI system and be able to duly monitor its\noperation, including in view of detecting and addressing anomalies, dysfunctions and unexpected performance;\n(b) to remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on the output produced by a high-risk\nAI system (automation bias), in particular for high-risk AI systems used to provide information or recommendations for\ndecisions to be taken by natural persons;\n(c) to correctly interpret the high-risk AI system’s output, taking into account, for example, the interpretation tools and\nmethods available;\nEN OJ L, 12.7.2024\n60/144 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n(d) to decide, in any particular situation, not to use the high-risk AI system or to otherwise disregard, override or reverse\nthe output of the high-risk AI system;\n(e) to intervene in the operation of the high-risk AI system or interrupt the system through a ‘stop’ button or a similar\nprocedure that allows the system to come to a halt in a safe state.\n5. For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1(a) of Annex III, the measures referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article\nshall be such as to ensure that, in addition, no action or decision is taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification\nresulting from the system unless that identification has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural\npersons with the necessary competence, training and authority.\nThe requirement for a separate verification by at least two natural persons shall not apply to high-risk AI systems used for\nthe purposes of law enforcement, migration,", "ounded. According to the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are\ndeveloped and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is\nfunctioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety\nmeans that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience\nagainst attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and\nminimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in\naccordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of\nquality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate\ntraceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as\nwell as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their\nrights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that\nincludes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding\ndiscriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental\nwell-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as\nwell as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the\nindividual, society and democracy. The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the\ndesign and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this\nRegulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are\nencouraged to take into account, as appropriate, the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best\npractices and standards.\n(28) Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for\nmanipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices are particularly harmful and abusive and\nshould be prohibited because they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality,\ndemocracy and the rule of law and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including the right to\nnon-discrimination, to data protection and to privacy and the rights of the child.\n(29", "should be performed solely with reference to the rules governing the legality of the content.\nEN OJ L, 12.7.2024\n34/144 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n(137) Compliance with the transparency obligations for the AI systems covered by this Regulation should not be\ninterpreted as indicating that the use of the AI system or its output is lawful under this Regulation or other Union\nand Member State law and should be without prejudice to other transparency obligations for deployers of AI systems\nlaid down in Union or national law.\n(138) AI is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires regulatory oversight and a safe and controlled space\nfor experimentation, while ensuring responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk\nmitigation measures. To ensure a legal framework that promotes innovation, is future-proof and resilient to\ndisruption, Member States should ensure that their national competent authorities establish at least one AI\nregulatory sandbox at national level to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict\nregulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service. Member States\ncould also fulfil this obligation through participating in already existing regulatory sandboxes or establishing jointly\na sandbox with one or more Member States’ competent authorities, insofar as this participation provides equivalent\nlevel of national coverage for the participating Member States. AI regulatory sandboxes could be established in\nphysical, digital or hybrid form and may accommodate physical as well as digital products. Establishing authorities\nshould also ensure that the AI regulatory sandboxes have the adequate resources for their functioning, including\nfinancial and human resources.\n(139) The objectives of the AI regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI innovation by establishing a controlled\nexperimentation and testing environment in the development and pre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring\ncompliance of the innovative AI systems with this Regulation and other relevant Union and national law. Moreover,\nthe AI regulatory sandboxes should aim to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities’\noversight and understanding of the opportunities, emerging risks and the impacts of AI use, to facilitate regulatory\nlearning for authorities and undertakings, including with a view to future adaptions of the legal framework, to\nsupport cooperation and the sharing of best practices with the authorities involved in the AI regulatory sandbox,\nand to accelerate access to markets, including by removing barriers for SMEs, including start-ups. AI regulatory\nsandboxes should be widely available throughout the Union, and particular attention"]}
