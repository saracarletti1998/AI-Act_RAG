To the\nextent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of\npersonal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for remote biometric identification for the purpose of\nlaw enforcement, of the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law\nenforcement and of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it is\nappropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 TFEU. In light of\nthose specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate to consult the European Data Protection\nBoard.\n(4) AI is a fast evolving family of technologies that contributes to a wide array of economic, environmental and societal\nbenefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations\nand resource allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of AI\ncan provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial\noutcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture,\ninfrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy\nefficiency, environmental monitoring, the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and climate\nchange mitigation and adaptation.\n(5) At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use, and level of technological\ndevelopment, AI may generate risks and cause harm to public interests and fundamental rights that are protected by\nUnion law. Such harm might be material or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic\nharm.\n(6) Given the major impact that AI can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital for AI and its regulatory\nframework to be developed in accordance with Union values as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European\nUnion (TEU), the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and, pursuant to Article 6 TEU, the\nCharter. As a prerequisite, AI should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, with the\nultimate aim of increasing human well-being.\n(7) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, safety and\nfundamental rights, common rules for high-risk AI systems should be established.

It should serve as a tool for people, with the\nultimate aim of increasing human well-being.\n(7) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, safety and\nfundamental rights, common rules for high-risk AI systems should be established. Those rules should be consistent\nwith the Charter, non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments. They should\nalso take into account the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade and the\nEthics guidelines for trustworthy AI of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG).\n(8) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster the development, use\nand uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such\nas health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and\nenvironmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the\nplacing on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring\nthe smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free\nmovement of goods and services. Those rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights,\nsupportive of new innovative solutions, enabling a European ecosystem of public and private actors creating AI\nsystems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the\nUnion. By laying down those rules as well as measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on small and\nmedium enterprises (SMEs), including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of promoting the European\nhuman-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical AI as\nstated by the European Council (\n5\n), and it ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the\nEuropean Parliament (\n6\n).\nEN OJ L, 12.7.2024\n2/144 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n(\n5\n) European Council, Special meeting of the European Council (1 and 2 October 2020) — Conclusions, EUCO 13/20, 2020, p. 6.\n(\n6\n) European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with recommendations to the Commission"}

{"id": "ai_act_8", "text": "system’ in this Regulation should be clearly defined and should be closely aligned with the work of\ninternational organisations working on AI to ensure legal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide\nacceptance, while providing the flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field.\nMoreover, the definition should be based on key characteristics of AI systems that distinguish it from simpler\ntraditional software systems or programming approaches and should not cover systems that are based on the rules\ndefined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their\ncapability to infer. This capability to infer refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content,\nrecommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual environments, and to a capability of AI\nsystems to derive models or algorithms, or both, from inputs or data. The techniques that enable inference while\nbuilding an AI system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives,\nand logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic representation of the\ntask to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer transcends basic data processing by enabling learning,\nreasoning or modelling. The term ‘machine-based’ refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference\nto explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives or\nto implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system\nin a specific context. For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood to be the contexts in\nwhich the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system reflect different functions performed by\nAI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with\nvarying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human\ninvolvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could\nexhibit after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use. AI systems\ncan be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically\nintegrated into the product (embedded) or serves the functionality of the product without being integrated therein\n(non-embedded).\n(13) The notion of ‘deployer’ referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any natural or legal person, including\na public authority, agency or other body, using an AI system under its"}

Depending on the type of AI system, the use of the system may\naffect persons other than the deployer.\n(14) The notion of ‘biometric data’ used in this Regulation should be interpreted in light of the notion of biometric data\nas defined in Article 4, point (14) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Article 3, point (18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725\nand Article 3, point (13) of Directive (EU) 2016/680. Biometric data can allow for the authentication, identification\nor categorisation of natural persons and for the recognition of emotions of natural persons.\n(15) The notion of ‘biometric identification’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined as the automated recognition\nof physical, physiological and behavioural human features such as the face, eye movement, body shape, voice,\nprosody, gait, posture, heart rate, blood pressure, odour, keystrokes characteristics, for the purpose of establishing an\nindividual’s identity by comparing biometric data of that individual to stored biometric data of individuals in\na reference database, irrespective of whether the individual has given its consent or not. This excludes AI systems\nintended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that\na specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the\nsole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises.\nEN OJ L, 12.7.2024\n4/144 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\n(\n15) Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October 2022 on a Single Market For Digital\nServices and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act) (OJ L 277, 27.10.2022, p. 1).\n(16"}

Such specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex,\nage, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, behavioural or personality traits, language, religion, membership of a national\nminority, sexual or political orientation. This does not include biometric categorisation systems that are a purely\nancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial service, meaning that the feature cannot, for objective\ntechnical reasons, be used without the principal service, and the integration of that feature or functionality is not\na means to circumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation. For example, filters categorising facial or body\nfeatures used on online marketplaces could constitute such an ancillary feature as they can be used only in relation to\nthe principal service which consists in selling a product by allowing the consumer to preview the display of the\nproduct on him or herself and help the consumer to make a purchase decision. Filters used on online social network\nservices which categorise facial or body features to allow users to add or modify pictures or videos could also be\nconsidered to be ancillary feature as such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network\nservices consisting in the sharing of content online.\n(17) The notion of ‘remote biometric identification system’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined functionally,\nas an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, typically at\na distance, through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference\ndatabase, irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. Such remote\nbiometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple persons or their behaviour simultaneously in\norder to facilitate significantly the identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes\nAI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the sole purpose of which\nis to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of\na natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device"}

That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact on fundamental\nrights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric identification systems which may be used for the\nprocessing of the biometric data of a large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of\n‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all\ninstantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this regard, there should be no\nscope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing\nfor minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated\nby a camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data\nhas already been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant delay. This involves\nmaterial, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which\nhas been generated before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.\n(18) The notion of ‘emotion recognition system’ referred to in this Regulation should be defined as an AI system for the\npurpose of identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data.\nThe notion refers to emotions or intentions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, embarrassment,\nexcitement, shame, contempt, satisfaction and amusement. It does not include physical states, such as pain or\nfatigue, including, for example, systems used in detecting the state of fatigue of professional pilots or drivers for the\npurpose of preventing accidents. This does also not include the mere detection of readily apparent expressions,\ngestures or movements, unless they are used for identifying or inferring emotions. Those expressions can be basic\nfacial expressions, such as a frown or a smile, or gestures such as the movement of hands, arms or head, or\ncharacteristics of a person’s voice, such as a raised voice or whisper"}

Online spaces are not\ncovered, as they are not physical spaces. Whether a given space is accessible to the public should however be\ndetermined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand.\n(20) In order to obtain the greatest benefits from AI systems while protecting fundamental rights, health and safety and to\nenable democratic control, AI literacy should equip providers, deployers and affected persons with the necessary\nnotions to make informed decisions regarding AI systems. Those notions may vary with regard to the relevant\ncontext and can include understanding the correct application of technical elements during the AI system’s\ndevelopment phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the suitable ways in which to interpret the AI system’s\noutput, and, in the case of affected persons, the knowledge necessary to understand how decisions taken with the\nassistance of AI will have an impact on them. In the context of the application this Regulation, AI literacy should\nprovide all relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights required to ensure the appropriate compliance and\nits correct enforcement. Furthermore, the wide implementation of AI literacy measures and the introduction of\nappropriate follow-up actions could contribute to improving working conditions and ultimately sustain the\nconsolidation, and innovation path of trustworthy AI in the Union. The European Artificial Intelligence Board (the\n‘Board’) should support the Commission, to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding of the\nbenefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems. In cooperation with the relevant\nstakeholders, the Commission and the Member States should facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct\nto advance AI literacy among persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI.\n(21) In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of individuals across the\nUnion, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory\nmanner, irrespective of whether they are established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI\nsystems established within"}

This is the case, for example, where an operator\nestablished in the Union contracts certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an\nactivity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk. In those circumstances, the AI system used\nin a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and\nprovide to the contracting operator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing,\nwithout that AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union.

That approach should tailor the type and content of such rules to the intensity and\nscope of the risks that AI systems can generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable AI practices,\nto lay down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and to lay down\ntransparency obligations for certain AI systems.\nOJ L, 12.7.2024 EN\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj 7/144\n(27) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to\nrecall the 2019 Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI developed by the independent AI HLEG appointed by the\nCommission. In those guidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which are\nintended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include human agency and\noversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination\nand fairness; societal and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding\nrequirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those guidelines contribute to the design of\ncoherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is\nfounded.

Technical robustness and safety\nmeans that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience\nagainst attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and\nminimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in\naccordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of\nquality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate\ntraceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as\nwell as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their\nrights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that\nincludes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding\ndiscriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law.

The placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the\nobjective to or the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in particular having\nsufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological health or financial interests are likely to occur, are\nparticularly dangerous and should therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as\naudio, image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human perception, or other\nmanipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s autonomy, decision-making or free choice in\nways that people are not consciously aware of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be\ndeceived or are not able to control or resist them.

Consistent with the objectives of Union harmonisation legislation to\nfacilitate the free movement of products in the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant\nproducts find their way into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product as\na whole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and mitigated. For instance,\nincreasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be\nable to safely operate and performs their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where\nthe stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics systems and systems\nsupporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate.\n(48) The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights protected by the Charter is of\nparticular relevance when classifying an AI system as high risk.

Relevant work-related contractual relationships\nshould, in a meaningful manner, involve employees and persons providing services through platforms as referred to\nin the Commission Work Programme 2021. Throughout the recruitment process and in the evaluation, promotion,\nor retention of persons in work-related contractual relationships, such systems may perpetuate historical patterns of\ndiscrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial\nor ethnic origins or sexual orientation. AI systems used to monitor the performance and behaviour of such persons\nmay also undermine their fundamental rights to data protection and privacy.\n(58) Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to and enjoyment of certain\nessential private and public services and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve\none’s standard of living. In particular, natural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits\nand services from public authorities namely healthcare services, social security benefits, social services providing\nprotection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or old age and loss of employment\nand social and housing assistance, are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position\nin relation to the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services\nshould be granted, denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, including whether beneficiaries are\nlegitimately entitled to such benefits or services, those systems may have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood\nand may infringe their fundamental rights, such as the right to social protection, non-discrimination, human dignity\nor an effective remedy and should therefore be classified as high-risk. Nonetheless, this Regulation should not\nhamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration, which would stand to\nbenefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided that those systems do not entail a high risk to\nlegal and natural persons. In addition, AI systems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural\npersons should be classified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine those persons’ access to financial resources\nor essential services such as housing, electricity, and telecommunication services.

AI systems used for those purposes\nmay lead to discrimination between persons or groups and may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination,\nsuch as that based on racial or ethnic origins, gender, disabilities, age or sexual orientation, or may create new forms\nof discriminatory impacts. However, AI systems provided for by Union law for the purpose of detecting fraud in the\noffering of financial services and for prudential purposes to calculate credit institutions’ and insurance undertakings’\ncapital requirements should not be considered to be high-risk under this Regulation. Moreover, AI systems intended\nEN OJ L, 12.7.2024\n16/144 ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj\nto be used for risk assessment and pricing in relation to natural persons for health and life insurance can also have\na significant impact on persons’ livelihood and if not duly designed, developed and used, can infringe their\nfundamental rights and can lead to serious consequences for people’s life and health, including financial exclusion\nand discrimination. Finally, AI systems used to evaluate and classify emergency calls by natural persons or to\ndispatch or establish priority in the dispatching of emergency first response services, including by police, firefighters\nand medical aid, as well as of emergency healthcare patient triage systems, should also be classified as high-risk since\nthey make decisions in very critical situations for the life and health of persons and their property.\n(59) Given their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving certain uses of AI systems are\ncharacterised by a significant degree of power imbalance and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of\na natural person’s liberty as well as other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In\nparticular, if the AI system is not trained with high-quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its\nperformance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or\notherwise put into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner.\nFurthermore, the exercise of important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and\nto a fair trial as well as the right of defence"}

It is therefore appropriate to\nclassify as high-risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems\nintended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and transparency is particularly\nimportant to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and ensure accountability and effective redress. In view of the\nnature of the activities and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI systems should include in particular AI\nsystems intended to be used by or on behalf of law enforcement authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices,\nor agencies in support of law enforcement authorities for assessing the risk of a natural person to become a victim of\ncriminal offences, as polygraphs and similar tools, for the evaluation of the reliability of evidence in in the course of\ninvestigation or prosecution of criminal offences, and, insofar as not prohibited under this Regulation, for assessing\nthe risk of a natural person offending or reoffending not solely on the basis of the profiling of natural persons or the\nassessment of personality traits and characteristics or the past criminal behaviour of natural persons or groups, for\nprofiling in the course of detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences.

It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as their use is permitted under\nrelevant Union and national law, AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of competent public authorities or\nby Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies charged with tasks in the fields of migration, asylum and border\ncontrol management as polygraphs and similar tools, for assessing certain risks posed by natural persons entering\nthe territory of a Member State or applying for visa or asylum, for assisting competent public authorities for the\nexamination, including related assessment of the reliability of evidence, of applications for asylum, visa and residence\npermits and associated complaints with regard to the objective to establish the eligibility of the natural persons\napplying for a status, for the purpose of detecting, recognising or identifying natural persons in the context of\nmigration, asylum and border control management, with the exception of verification of travel documents.

That process should be aimed at identifying and mitigating the relevant\nrisks of AI systems on health, safety and fundamental rights. The risk-management system should be regularly\nreviewed and updated to ensure its continuing effectiveness, as well as justification and documentation of any\nsignificant decisions and actions taken subject to this Regulation.

The risk-management system should adopt the most appropriate\nrisk-management measures in light of the state of the art in AI. When identifying the most appropriate\nrisk-management measures, the provider should document and explain the choices made and, when relevant,\ninvolve experts and external stakeholders. In identifying the reasonably foreseeable misuse of high-risk AI systems,\nthe provider should cover uses of AI systems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and\nprovided for in the instruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily predictable\nhuman behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of a particular AI system. Any known or\nforeseeable circumstances related to the use of the high-risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or\nunder conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or fundamental\nrights should be included in the instructions for use that are provided by the provider. This is to ensure that the\ndeployer is aware and takes them into account when using the high-risk AI system.

Those requirements are necessary to effectively\nmitigate the risks for health, safety and fundamental rights. As no other less trade restrictive measures are reasonably\navailable those requirements are not unjustified restrictions to trade.\n(67) High-quality data and access to high-quality data plays a vital role in providing structure and in ensuring the\nperformance of many AI systems, especially when techniques involving the training of models are used, with a view\nto ensure that the high-risk AI system performs as intended and safely and it does not become a source of\ndiscrimination prohibited by Union law. High-quality data sets for training, validation and testing require the\nimplementation of appropriate data governance and management practices. Data sets for training, validation and\ntesting, including the labels, should be relevant, sufficiently representative, and to the best extent possible free of\nerrors and complete in view of the intended purpose of the system. In order to facilitate compliance with Union data\nprotection law, such as Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data governance and management practices should include, in\nthe case of personal data, transparency about the original purpose of the data collection.

Results provided by AI systems could be\ninfluenced by such inherent biases that are inclined to gradually increase and thereby perpetuate and amplify existing\ndiscrimination, in particular for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups, including racial or ethnic groups.\nThe requirement for the data sets to be to the best extent possible complete and free of errors should not affect the\nuse of privacy-preserving techniques in the context of the development and testing of AI systems. In particular, data\nsets should take into account, to the extent required by their intended purpose, the features, characteristics or\nelements that are particular to the specific geographical, contextual, behavioural or functional setting which the AI\nsystem is intended to be used. The requirements related to data governance can be complied with by having recourse\nto third parties that offer certified compliance services including verification of data governance, data set integrity,\nand data training, validation and testing practices, as far as compliance with the data requirements of this Regulation\nare ensured.\n(68) For the development and assessment of high-risk AI systems, certain actors, such as providers, notified bodies and\nother relevant entities, such as European Digital Innovation Hubs, testing experimentation facilities and researchers,\nshould be able to access and use high-quality data sets within the fields of activities of those actors which are related\nto this Regulation. European common data spaces established by the Commission and the facilitation of data sharing\nbetween businesses and with government in the public interest will be instrumental to provide trustful, accountable\nand non-discriminatory access to high-quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. For\nexample, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and the\ntraining of AI algorithms on those data sets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy\nmanner, and with an appropriate institutional governance.

Measures taken by providers to ensure\ncompliance with those principles may include not only anonymisation and encryption, but also the use of\ntechnology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and allows training of AI systems without the\ntransmission between parties or copying of the raw or structured data themselves, without prejudice to the\nrequirements on data governance provided for in this Regulation.\n(70) In order to protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result from the bias in AI systems, the\nproviders should, exceptionally, to the extent that it is strictly necessary for the purpose of ensuring bias detection\nand correction in relation to the high-risk AI systems, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights\nand freedoms of natural persons and following the application of all applicable conditions laid down under this\nRegulation in addition to the conditions laid down in Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive\n(EU) 2016/680, be able to process also special categories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest\nwithin the meaning of Article 9(2), point (g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(2), point (g) of Regulation\n(EU) 2018/1725.\n(71) Having comprehensible information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed and how they perform\nthroughout their lifetime is essential to enable traceability of those systems, verify compliance with the requirements\nunder this Regulation, as well as monitoring of their operations and post market monitoring.

Such\ninformation should include the characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance of the AI system. Those\nwould cover information on possible known and foreseeable circumstances related to the use of the high-risk AI\nsystem, including deployer action that may influence system behaviour and performance, under which the AI system\ncan lead to risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights, on the changes that have been pre-determined and\nassessed for conformity by the provider and on the relevant human oversight measures, including the measures to\nfacilitate the interpretation of the outputs of the AI system by the deployers. Transparency, including the\naccompanying instructions for use, should assist deployers in the use of the system and support informed decision\nmaking by them. Deployers should, inter alia, be in a better position to make the correct choice of the system that\nthey intend to use in light of the obligations applicable to them, be educated about the intended and precluded uses,\nand use the AI system correctly and as appropriate.

To\nthat end, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing\non the market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the\nsystem is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive\nto the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary\ncompetence, training and authority to carry out that role. It is also essential, as appropriate, to ensure that high-risk\nAI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a natural person to whom human oversight has been assigned\nto make informed decisions if, when and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, or stop\nthe system if it does not perform as intended. Considering the significant consequences for persons in the case of an\nincorrect match by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to provide for an enhanced human\noversight requirement for those systems so that no action or decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of\nthe identification resulting from the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two\nnatural persons. Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person operating or using the\nsystem.

Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental\nrights, for example due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.\n(76) Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts to alter their use,\nbehaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by malicious third parties exploiting the system’s\nvulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data\npoisoning) or trained models (e.g. adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit vulnerabilities in the AI\nsystem’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks,\nsuitable measures, such as security controls, should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also\ntaking into account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.\n(77) Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in this Regulation, high-risk AI\nsystems which fall within the scope of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on horizontal\ncybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements, in accordance with that regulation may demonstrate\ncompliance with the cybersecurity requirements of this Regulation by fulfilling the essential cybersecurity\nrequirements set out in that regulation. When high-risk AI systems fulfil the essential requirements of a regulation of\nthe European Parliament and of the Council on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital\nelements, they should be deemed compliant with the cybersecurity requirements set out in this Regulation in so far\nas the achievement of those requirements is demonstrated in the EU declaration of conformity or parts thereof\nissued under"}

To that end, the assessment of the cybersecurity risks, associated to a product with\ndigital elements classified as high-risk AI system according to this Regulation, carried out under a regulation of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital\nelements, should consider risks to the cyber resilience of an AI system as regards attempts by unauthorised third\nparties to alter its use, behaviour or performance, including AI specific vulnerabilities such as data poisoning or\nadversarial attacks, as well as, as relevant, risks to fundamental rights as required by this Regulation.\n(78) The conformity assessment procedure provided by this Regulation should apply in relation to the essential\ncybersecurity requirements of a product with digital elements covered by a regulation of the European Parliament\nand of the Council on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements and classified as\na high-risk AI system under this Regulation.

Given the\ngrowing importance and use of AI systems, the application of universal design principles to all new technologies and\nservices should ensure full and equal access for everyone potentially affected by or using AI technologies, including\npersons with disabilities, in a way that takes full account of their inherent dignity and diversity. It is therefore\nessential that providers ensure full compliance with accessibility requirements, including Directive (EU) 2016/2102\nof the European Parliament and of the Council (\n38) and Directive (EU) 2019/882.

Providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to obligations regarding quality management\nsystems under relevant sectoral Union law should have the possibility to include the elements of the quality\nmanagement system provided for in this Regulation as part of the existing quality management system provided for\nin that other sectoral Union law. The complementarity between this Regulation and existing sectoral Union law\nshould also be taken into account in future standardisation activities or guidance adopted by the Commission. Public\nauthorities which put into service high-risk AI systems for their own use may adopt and implement the rules for the\nquality management system as part of the quality management system adopted at a national or regional level, as\nappropriate, taking into account the specificities of the sector and the competences and organisation of the public\nauthority concerned.\n(82) To enable enforcement of this Regulation and create a level playing field for operators, and, taking into account the\ndifferent forms of making available of digital products, it is important to ensure that, under all circumstances,\na person established in the Union can provide authorities with all the necessary information on the compliance of an\nAI system. Therefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union, providers established in third\ncountries should, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative established in the Union. This authorised\nrepresentative plays a pivotal role in ensuring the compliance of the high-risk AI systems placed on the market or\nput into service in the Union by those providers who are not established in the Union and in serving as their contact\nperson established in the Union.\n(83) In light of the nature and complexity of the value chain for AI systems and in line with the New Legislative\nFramework, it is essential to ensure legal certainty and facilitate the compliance with this Regulation.

For example, an operator could act as a distributor and an importer at the\nsame time.\n(84) To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, any distributor, importer,\ndeployer or other third-party should be considered to be a provider of a high-risk AI system and therefore assume all\nthe relevant obligations. This would be the case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system\nalready placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that the\nobligations are allocated otherwise. This would also be the case if that party makes a substantial modification to\na high-risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into service in a way that it\nremains a high-risk AI system in accordance with this Regulation, or if it modifies the intended purpose of an AI\nsystem, including a general-purpose AI system, which has not been classified as high-risk and has already been\nplaced on the market or put into service, in a way that the AI system becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance\nwith this Regulation.

Therefore, due to their particular nature and in order to ensure a fair sharing of responsibilities along the\nAI value chain, the providers of such systems should, irrespective of whether they may be used as high-risk AI\nsystems as such by other providers or as components of high-risk AI systems and unless provided otherwise under\nthis Regulation, closely cooperate with the providers of the relevant high-risk AI systems to enable their compliance\nwith the relevant obligations under this Regulation and with the competent authorities established under this\nRegulation.\n(86) Where, under the conditions laid down in this Regulation, the provider that initially placed the AI system on the\nmarket or put it into service should no longer be considered to be the provider for the purposes of this Regulation,\nand when that provider has not expressly excluded the change of the AI system into a high-risk AI system, the\nformer provider should nonetheless closely cooperate and make available the necessary information and provide the\nreasonably expected technical access and other assistance that are required for the fulfilment of the obligations set\nout in this Regulation, in particular regarding the compliance with the conformity assessment of high-risk AI\nsystems.\n(87) In addition, where a high-risk AI system that is a safety component of a product which falls within the scope of\nUnion harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework is not placed on the market or put into\nservice independently from the product, the product manufacturer defined in that legislation should comply with\nthe obligations of the provider established in this Regulation and should, in particular, ensure that the AI system\nembedded in the final product complies with the requirements of this Regulation.\n(88) Along the AI value chain multiple parties often supply AI systems, tools and services but also components or\nprocesses that are incorporated by the provider into the AI system with various objectives, including the model\ntraining, model retraining, model testing and evaluation, integration into software, or other aspects of model\ndevelopment.

These\nmodels are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self-supervised,\nunsupervised or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be placed on the market in various ways,\nincluding through libraries, application programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy.\nThese models may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential\ncomponents of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models require the addition of further\ncomponents, such as for example a user interface, to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and\nform part of AI systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general-purpose AI models and for\ngeneral-purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or\nform part of an AI system.

Since systemic risks result from particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI\nmodel should be considered to present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of\nappropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its reach.\nHigh-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities\nrecorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better\nunderstood after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to the state of the\nart at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of computation used for the training of\nthe general-purpose AI model measured in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model\ncapabilities. The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used across the\nactivities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as\npre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations\nshould be set, which, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is\na general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological\nand industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, and should be\nsupplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage\nwith the scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks\nfor the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its capabilities and\nassociated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take into account the way the model will be placed\non the market or the number of users it may affect.

To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the\nCommission to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-purpose AI model\nwith systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an impact equivalent to those captured by the set\nthreshold. That decision should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of\na general-purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as quality or size of the\ntraining data set, number of business and end users, its input and output modalities, its level of autonomy and\nscalability, or the tools it has access to. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as\na general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account and may\ndecide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks.\n(112) It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks.\nA general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to\nbe a general-purpose AI models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks\nafter the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements\nthat lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the threshold of floating point operations\nbecause training of general-purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of\ncompute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to know if their model would\nmeet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of that notification, the provider should be able to\ndemonstrate that, because of its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present\nsystemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. That\ninformation is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with\nsystemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on.

To achieve those objectives, this Regulation should\nrequire providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in particular prior to its first placing on the market,\nincluding conducting and documenting adversarial testing of models, also, as appropriate, through internal or\nindependent external testing. In addition, providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should\ncontinuously assess and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting in place risk-management policies,\nsuch as accountability and governance processes, implementing post-market monitoring, taking appropriate\nmeasures along the entire model’s lifecycle and cooperating with relevant actors along the AI value chain.\n(115) Providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate possible systemic risks.

Furthermore, providers should ensure an adequate level of\ncybersecurity protection for the model and its physical infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle.\nCybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use or attacks should duly consider\naccidental model leakage, unauthorised releases, circumvention of safety measures, and defence against cyberattacks,\nunauthorised access or model theft. That protection could be facilitated by securing model weights, algorithms,\nservers, and data sets, such as through operational security measures for information security, specific cybersecurity\npolicies, adequate technical and established solutions, and cyber and physical access controls, appropriate to the\nrelevant circumstances and the risks involved.\n(116) The AI Office should encourage and facilitate the drawing up, review and adaptation of codes of practice, taking into\naccount international approaches. All providers of general-purpose AI models could be invited to participate. To\nensure that the codes of practice reflect the state of the art and duly take into account a diverse set of perspectives,\nthe AI Office should collaborate with relevant national competent authorities, and could, where appropriate, consult\nwith civil society organisations and other relevant stakeholders and experts, including the Scientific Panel, for the\ndrawing up of such codes.

Providers of general-purpose AI\nmodels should furthermore be able to demonstrate compliance using alternative adequate means, if codes of practice\nor harmonised standards are not available, or they choose not to rely on those.\n(118) This Regulation regulates AI systems and AI models by imposing certain requirements and obligations for relevant\nmarket actors that are placing them on the market, putting into service or use in the Union, thereby complementing\nobligations for providers of intermediary services that embed such systems or models into their services regulated by\nRegulation (EU) 2022/2065. To the extent that such systems or models are embedded into designated very large\nonline platforms or very large online search engines, they are subject to the risk-management framework provided\nfor in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. Consequently, the corresponding obligations of this Regulation should be\npresumed to be fulfilled, unless significant systemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 emerge and are\nidentified in such models. Within this framework, providers of very large online platforms and very large online\nsearch engines are obliged to assess potential systemic risks stemming from the design, functioning and use of their\nservices, including how the design of algorithmic systems used in the service may contribute to such risks, as well as\nsystemic risks stemming from potential misuses. Those providers are also obliged to take appropriate mitigating\nmeasures in observance of fundamental rights.\n(119) Considering the quick pace of innovation and the technological evolution of digital services in scope of different\ninstruments of Union law in particular having in mind the usage and the perception of their recipients, the AI\nsystems subject to this Regulation may be provided as intermediary services or parts thereof within the meaning of\nRegulation ("}

For example, AI systems\nmay be used to provide online search engines, in particular, to the extent that an AI system such as an online chatbot\nperforms searches of, in principle, all websites, then incorporates the results into its existing knowledge and uses the\nupdated knowledge to generate a single output that combines different sources of information.\n(120) Furthermore, obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this Regulation to enable the\ndetection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are artificially generated or manipulated are particularly\nrelevant to facilitate the effective implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards\nthe obligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and\nmitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been artificially generated or\nmanipulated, in particular risk of the actual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse\nand electoral processes, including through disinformation.\n(121) Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to providers to ensure compliance with this\nRegulation, in line with the state of the art, to promote innovation as well as competitiveness and growth in the\nsingle market.

In certain circumstances, the use\nof these systems should therefore be subject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the\nrequirements and obligations for high-risk AI systems and subject to targeted exceptions to take into account the\nspecial need of law enforcement. In particular, natural persons should be notified that they are interacting with an AI\nsystem, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a natural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant\nand circumspect taking into account the circumstances and the context of use. When implementing that obligation,\nthe characteristics of natural persons belonging to vulnerable groups due to their age or disability should be taken\ninto account to the extent the AI system is intended to interact with those groups as well. Moreover, natural persons\nshould be notified when they are exposed to AI systems that, by processing their biometric data, can identify or infer\nthe emotions or intentions of those persons or assign them to specific categories. Such specific categories can relate\nto aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, personal traits, ethnic origin, personal preferences and\ninterests. Such information and notifications should be provided in accessible formats for persons with disabilities.\nOJ L, 12.7.2024 EN\nELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj 33/144\n(133) A variety of AI systems can generate large quantities of synthetic content that becomes increasingly hard for humans\nto distinguish from human-generated and authentic content. The wide availability and increasing capabilities of\nthose systems have a significant impact on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, raising new risks of\nmisinformation and manipulation at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer deception. In light of those impacts,\nthe fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to trace origin of information, it is\nappropriate to require providers of those systems to embed technical solutions that enable marking in a machine\nreadable format and detection that the output has been generated or manipulated by an AI system and not a human.\nSuch techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is\ntechnically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as\nwatermarks,"}

When implementing this obligation,\nproviders should also take into account the specificities and the limitations of the different types of content and the\nrelevant technological and market developments in the field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state of the\nart. Such techniques and methods can be implemented at the level of the AI system or at the level of the AI model,\nincluding general-purpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of this obligation by the\ndownstream provider of the AI system. To remain proportionate, it is appropriate to envisage that this marking\nobligation should not cover AI systems performing primarily an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems\nnot substantially altering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof.\n(134) Further to the technical solutions employed by the providers of the AI system, deployers who use an AI system to\ngenerate or manipulate image, audio or video content that appreciably resembles existing persons, objects, places,\nentities or events and would falsely appear to a person to be authentic or truthful (deep fakes), should also clearly\nand distinguishably disclose that the content has been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the AI output\naccordingly and disclosing its artificial origin.

In those cases, the transparency obligation for deep fakes set out in this\nRegulation is limited to disclosure of the existence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate\nmanner that does not hamper the display or enjoyment of the work, including its normal exploitation and use, while\nmaintaining the utility and quality of the work.

To ensure a legal framework that promotes innovation, is future-proof and resilient to\ndisruption, Member States should ensure that their national competent authorities establish at least one AI\nregulatory sandbox at national level to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict\nregulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service.

The participation in the AI regulatory sandbox should focus on issues that\nraise legal uncertainty for providers and prospective providers to innovate, experiment with AI in the Union and\ncontribute to evidence-based regulatory learning. The supervision of the AI systems in the AI regulatory sandbox\nshould therefore cover their development, training, testing and validation before the systems are placed on the\nmarket or put into service, as well as the notion and occurrence of substantial modification that may require a new\nconformity assessment procedure. Any significant risks identified during the development and testing of such AI\nsystems should result in adequate mitigation and, failing that, in the suspension of the development and testing\nprocess. Where appropriate, national competent authorities establishing AI regulatory sandboxes should cooperate\nwith other relevant authorities, including those supervising the protection of fundamental rights, and could allow for\nthe involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem such as national or European standardisation organisations,\nnotified bodies, testing and experimentation facilities, research and experimentation labs, European Digital\nInnovation Hubs and relevant stakeholder and civil society organisations.

It is also important to minimise the risks\nand enable oversight by competent authorities and therefore require prospective providers to have a real-world\ntesting plan submitted to competent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated sections in the EU\ndatabase subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the period for which the testing can be done and\nrequire additional safeguards for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups, as well as a written agreement\ndefining the roles and responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by competent\npersonnel involved in the real world testing. Furthermore, it is appropriate to envisage additional safeguards to\nensure that the predictions, recommendations or decisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and\ndisregarded and that personal data is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to\nparticipate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the Union data protection law. As\nregards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data collected and processed for the purpose of testing\nin real-world conditions should be transferred to third countries only where appropriate and applicable safeguards\nunder Union law are implemented, in particular in accordance with bases for transfer of personal data under Union\nlaw on data protection, while for non-personal data appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with\nUnion law, such as Regulations (EU) 2022/868 (\n42) and (EU) 2023/2854 (\n43) of the European Parliament and of the\nCouncil.\n(142) To ensure that AI leads to socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, Member States are encouraged to\nsupport and promote research and development of AI solutions in support of socially and environmentally\nbeneficial outcomes, such as AI-based solutions to increase accessibility for persons with disabilities, tackle\nsocio-economic inequalities, or meet environmental targets, by allocating sufficient resources, including public and\nUnion funding, and, where appropriate and provided that the eligibility and selection criteria are fulfilled,\nconsidering in particular projects which pursue such objectives.

The\nCommission should regularly assess the certification and compliance costs for SMEs, including start-ups, through\ntransparent consultations and should work with Member States to lower such costs. For example, translation costs\nrelated to mandatory documentation and communication with authorities may constitute a significant cost for\nproviders and other operators, in particular those of a smaller scale. Member States should possibly ensure that one\nof the languages determined and accepted by them for relevant providers’ documentation and for communication\nwith operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest possible number of cross-border deployers.

Due to the specific nature of Union institutions, agencies and bodies falling within\nthe scope of this Regulation, it is appropriate to designate the European Data Protection Supervisor as a competent\nmarket surveillance authority for them. This should be without prejudice to the designation of national competent\nauthorities by the Member States. Market surveillance activities should not affect the ability of the supervised entities\nto carry out their tasks independently, when such independence is required by Union law.\n(157) This Regulation is without prejudice to the competences, tasks, powers and independence of relevant national public\nauthorities or bodies which supervise the application of Union law protecting fundamental rights, including"}

Where necessary for their mandate, those national public authorities or\nbodies should also have access to any documentation created under this Regulation. A specific safeguard procedure\nshould be set for ensuring adequate and timely enforcement against AI systems presenting a risk to health, safety and\nfundamental rights.

However, for general-purpose AI systems that can\nbe used directly by deployers for at least one purpose that is classified as high-risk, market surveillance authorities\nshould cooperate with the AI Office to carry out evaluations of compliance and inform the Board and other market\nsurveillance authorities accordingly. Furthermore, market surveillance authorities should be able to request\nassistance from the AI Office where the market surveillance authority is unable to conclude an investigation on\na high-risk AI system because of its inability to access certain information related to the general-purpose AI model\non which the high-risk AI system is built.
